#Commands to create executable Python files
#Note: Creating Python - .exe files isn't optimal since Python is an interpreted and NOT Compiled Language. 
#Nevertheless, here's how you can create executables (Single / Multiple) with Python.

If your python file has several dependencies than you need to use NSIS to 
compile evrything into a single executable file (from a Zip file which contains the python file along with it's dependecies, 
i.e, drag [FILENAME.py] to the folder which contains all it's dependencies)

PyInstaller reads a Python script written by you. 
It analyzes your code to discover every other module and library your script needs in order to execute. ... â€“ and puts them with your script
in a single folder, or optionally in a single executable file.
----------------------------------------------------COMMANDS----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1: Install package - "pyinstaller": pip install pyinstaller
2: In CMD / Terminal Navigate to the Directory which contains the Python File, [FILENAME.py] for namesake.
3: Type the following command to deploy an executable file:

pyinstaller --onefile -w -i [ICON_NAME].ico [FILENAME.py]

--onefile---->For a Single executable files with all dependencies.
-w-------> top run in a new window.
-i-------> to include an image for the executable file. (Icon should be present in the same directory as [FILENAME])
